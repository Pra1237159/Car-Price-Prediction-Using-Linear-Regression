# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
### Overview

The pre-owned car market in India has seen a significant surge in demand, outpacing new car sales in recent years. While new car sales recorded 3.6 million units in 2018-19, the second-hand car market saw around 4 million transactions. This shift indicates that consumers are increasingly turning to used cars, even preferring them over new ones for replacements. The pre-owned car market's pricing dynamics differ vastly from the new car market, which is regulated by OEMs and dealership discounts. In contrast, used car pricing and supply are highly unpredictable, presenting both challenges and opportunities.

### The Challenge

As a data scientist in a tech start-up striving to establish itself in this competitive market, your goal is to develop a robust pricing model for used cars. This model should accurately predict car prices, enabling the business to implement effective differential pricing strategies. By understanding the market price, Cars4U can ensure they never sell below market value, maximizing profitability.

### Your Mission

1. **Analyze Market Trends**:
   - Study the market trends that influence used car pricing.
   - Identify key factors contributing to price fluctuations.

2. **Develop a Predictive Pricing Model**:
   - Utilize historical sales data and other relevant factors to build a predictive model.
   - Ensure the model accounts for the inherent uncertainties in the used car market.

3. **Implement Differential Pricing Strategies**:
   - Use the insights from your model to devise pricing strategies.
   - Help the business optimize its pricing to maintain competitiveness and profitability.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making**:
   - Leverage the model to make informed decisions about buying and selling used cars.
   - Ensure the business stays ahead in the rapidly evolving pre-owned car market.

By successfully developing and implementing this pricing model, Cars4U aims to navigate the complexities of the used car market, securing a foothold and driving growth in an increasingly competitive landscape.
